# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work
No real significant challenges, but it would have been nice to be able to successfully get the SQLi to update the database and verify the output for a salesperson was altered in the back-end DB.  But cool to see the blue site was vulnerabie vs. the green/red not and react / return different tangible responses to the attempted attacks.
